## Short Answer Questions:

**1.** Briefly describe one key challenge addressed by meta-learning compared to traditional machine learning.

**Answer:** One key challenge addressed is quickly adapting to new datasets with minimal fine-tuning, which is particularly relevant in real-world applications with dynamic and evolving data. 


**2.**  What are two different techniques discussed for implementing self-improvement within the Meta-Learning Project?


**Answer:** Two techniques for self-improvement are:

   * **Reinforcement learning:** This technique allows a system to learn through feedback from its previous actions, improving its performance over time.
   * **Online learning algorithms:**  These algorithms enable continuous learning and adaptation based on new information acquired as the project progresses.
